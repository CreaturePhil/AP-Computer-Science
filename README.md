Hello computer people!
For this class, there are some things you need on your computer:
First, you need a developer version of Java.  I would recommend that the most current version be downloaded as security vulnerabilities are constantly fixed.  Keep it up to date!
You want the JDK.  This is the developer kit that will enable you to program.  Java SE's JDK can be downloaded [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
If you are on a Linux machine, the development kit is usually already installed, but in case it isn't, you can use OpenJDK in the software center.
 
Second, you will need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  The one we will be using in class will be Eclipse.  It is not as "easy" as other versions, but it is the industry standard.  There are others out there that you may try, but you will have Eclipse in class.  Eclipse standard is the flavor that you want and it can be downloaded [here](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-43/keplerr).
